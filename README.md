## Prerequisites
- Many external binaries must installed manually through the system package manager. The configs do not automatically install external dependencies. This allows the system package manager to keep such dependencies up to date more easily.
  - See [this guide](https://gist.github.com/hfarrow/bc40bbef99019ae093b9f721db174070) for likely packages to install
  - TODO: make this README list required packages
